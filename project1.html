      <h4>Pitch</h4>
        <p>For this project I was tasked with creating a reading and studying space that gives the user a private area to relax. We were given tight restrictions on the size of the space, and the chair inside, because it was intended to be placed in the Simon Fraser University Surrey campus. Its intended use is for students of SFU to use between classes to have a private space to unwind and spend time as they would like.

      <h3 class="section-title">Process Analysis</h3>
        <p>I created this space and the chair inside to create a more natural feeling space. I used triangle cuts in the sides to allow for ventilation and light. I also designed the roof of the alcove to resemble a leaf, in order to aid in the natural feeling I was trying to convey as well as to create more cutouts for light and ventilation. Another feature of the roof is it is able to move up and down on the back hinge providing more light or more privacy for the user. Additionally I added a moveable panel that extends out the arm of the chair for students to use as a desk or extra table space if required.

        <p>A problem I faced when designing this space is the entrance. Because of our tight size restrictions there wasn't enough space to make it as big as I wanted, but I didn't want to sacrifice the style of entrance I have, because the curving hallway to enter creates a great amount of openness while still providing privacy. To solve this problem I had to sacrifice some leg room for the chair inside, however I believe this design is still effective.
</p>

        <p>I believe my design is very effective. I accomplished the design challenge as well as created a space that students would like to relax and study in.

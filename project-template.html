    <h2>Panel Pavilion</h2>
      <h3>Teammate : Tyler Barlow</h3>
      <h4>Pitch</h4>
        <p>For this project, we were tasked with designing an outdoor pavilion using panel architecture that would house three sculptures. We were given restrictions on the size of the space as well as the height. It was required to be two floors and wheelchair accessible.

      <h3 class="section-title">Process Analysis</h3>
        <p>My partner and I wanted to design a space that was very open and easy to navigate but would also be visually appealing. We used a variety of wall articulations on each floor to create an interesting space that would still allow a lot of natural light for the sculptures, as well as good airflow because this pavilion would be outside. We also used a technique of staggering the floor panels in order to achieve a more rounded looking space, even with the panel architecture. Lastly we made sure to create a space with easy circulation for visitors to find present wandering through.
</p>
<br>
        <p>One problem we had was finding an effective placement of the wheel chair ramp. Because we  had strict size restrictions we had to sacrifice our original size plan in order to fit the wheelchair ramp. However we did implement it effectively in the end.
</p>
<br>
        <p>I believe this project was very effective. We set out to use panel architecture in a unique way, while still retaining our plans of easy circulation and an interesting space overall.
